-- What do you think makes a successful AirBnB rental in this market? What factors seem to be at play the most?

Minimum nights seem to contribute the most to success in this market. Listings with above average  number of ratings have an average of 11 for minimum nights while below average number of ratings average 30 for minimum nights. The average price was close between these two groups($180 vs $140). I would suggest listings to keep the minimum nights as low as possible in this market.
